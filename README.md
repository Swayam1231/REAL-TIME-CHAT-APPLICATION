I built this real-time chat application using React.js on the frontend and Node.js with WebSockets on the backend. The goal was to create a smooth, responsive chatting experience where multiple users can join, send messages instantly, and see message history in real time. I used React hooks like useState and useEffect to manage state efficiently, and implemented WebSockets to enable real-time communication without page reloads. This project helped me deepen my understanding of full-stack development, especially handling real-time data flow between the client and server. Itâ€™s designed to be clean, scalable, and mobile-responsive.
